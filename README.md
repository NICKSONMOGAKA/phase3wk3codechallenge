Concerts Database Project
Overview
This project involves managing a database for concerts, bands, and venues. It uses raw SQL queries to handle database operations without using SQLAlchemy or any ORM. The main goal is to practice writing and executing SQL commands directly in Python.

Database Schema
The database consists of three tables:

Bands

name: The name of the band (Primary Key)
hometown: The hometown of the band
Venues

title: The title of the venue (Primary Key)
city: The city where the venue is located
Concerts

id: Auto-incrementing primary key
band_name: Name of the band (Foreign Key referencing bands.name)
venue_title: Title of the venue (Foreign Key referencing venues.title)
date: Date of the concert
Setup
To set up the database and create the required tables, run the following script:

python
Copy code
import sqlite3

def setup_database():
    conn = sqlite3.connect('concerts.db')
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute('''
        CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS bands (
            name TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
            hometown TEXT
        )
    ''')
    cursor.execute('''
        CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS venues (
            title TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
            city TEXT
        )
    ''')
    cursor.execute('''
        CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS concerts (
            id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
            band_name TEXT,
            venue_title TEXT,
            date TEXT,
            FOREIGN KEY (band_name) REFERENCES bands(name),
            FOREIGN KEY (venue_title) REFERENCES venues(title)
        )
    ''')
    conn.commit()
    conn.close()

setup_database()

# Retrieve concert info
concert = Concert(1)
print(concert.introduction())  # Example usage

# Get all venues where the band has performed
print(band.venues())

# Get the most frequent band at a venue
print(venue.most_frequent_band())
