Phase 3 Code Challenge: Concerts
For this assignment, we'll be working with a Concert domain.

We have three tables: Band (name and hometown), Venue (title and city), and Concert.

For our purposes, a Band has many concerts, a Venue has many concerts, and a Concert belongs to a band and to a venue. Band-Venue is a many-to-many relationship.

Note: You should sketch your domain on paper or on a whiteboard before starting to code.

Important: You will not be using SQLAlchemy for this challenge. Instead, use raw SQL queries. Write SQL queries directly in your Python methods to perform the necessary operations on the database.

What You Should Have:
Your schema should look like this:

bands Table:
Column	Type
name	String
hometown	String
venues Table:
Column	Type
title	String
city	String
You will need to create the schema for the concerts table, using the attributes specified in the deliverables below. You will also need to create the migrations for the above tables, following the same structure.

Deliverables
You will be writing methods that execute raw SQL queries to interact with your database. Use Python’s sqlite3 or psycopg2 library to run SQL commands.

Make sure to set up your database and tables using raw SQL commands before working on the deliverables.

Migrations
Before working on these deliverables, you need to create migrations for the concerts table. This is assuming you have already created and migrated the band and venues tables.

A Concert belongs to a Band and a Venue. In your migration, create any columns your concerts table will need to establish these relationships.

The concerts table should also have:

A date column that stores a string.
After creating the concerts table, use raw SQL to create instances of your data so you can test your code.

Object Relationship Methods
For the following methods, write SQL queries to retrieve the necessary data from the database.

Concert

Concert.band(): should return the Band instance for this concert.
Concert.venue(): should return the Venue instance for this concert.
Venue

Venue.concerts(): returns a collection of all concerts for the venue.
Venue.bands(): returns a collection of all bands who performed at the venue.
Band

Band.concerts(): should return a collection of all concerts the band has played.
Band.venues(): should return a collection of all venues the band has performed at.
Aggregate and Relationship Methods
Concert

Concert.hometown_show(): returns true if the concert is in the band's hometown, false if it is not. Use SQL joins to compare the band's hometown with the concert's venue city.
Concert.introduction(): returns a string with the band's introduction for this concert:
"Hello {venue city}!!!!! We are {band name} and we're from {band hometown}"
Band

Band.play_in_venue(venue, date): takes a venue (venue title) and date (as a string) as arguments, and creates a new concert for the band at that venue on that date. Insert the concert using raw SQL.
Band.all_introductions(): returns an array of strings representing all the introductions for this band.
Each introduction is in the form: "Hello {venue city}!!!!! We are {band name} and we're from {band hometown}"
Band.most_performances(): returns the Band that has played the most concerts. Use SQL GROUP BY and COUNT to identify the band with the most concerts.
Venue

Venue.concert_on(date): takes a date (string) as an argument and finds the first concert on that date at the venue.
Venue.most_frequent_band(): returns the band that has performed the most at the venue. You will need to count how many times each band has performed at this venue using a SQL GROUP BY query.
Guidelines
Use raw SQL exclusively for all queries.
Utilize JOINs, GROUP BY, and COUNT operations where appropriate.
You can use Python's database connection libraries (e.g., sqlite3 or psycopg2) to execute SQL queries in your methods.

To complete this assignment, we need to interact with a database using raw SQL queries. Let's break down the steps to set up your database schema, write migrations, and implement the required methods. We'll use SQLite and Python's sqlite3 library for this purpose.

1. Database Schema and Migrations
First, let's create the schema for the bands, venues, and concerts tables. Here's how you can do it:

Schema
Bands Table
sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE bands (
    name TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    hometown TEXT
);
Venues Table
sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE venues (
    title TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    city TEXT
);
Concerts Table
The concerts table will have foreign keys to bands and venues, as well as a date column.

sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE concerts (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    band_name TEXT,
    venue_title TEXT,
    date TEXT,
    FOREIGN KEY (band_name) REFERENCES bands(name),
    FOREIGN KEY (venue_title) REFERENCES venues(title)
);
Migration Example Using Python
To run these SQL commands using Python, you can use the sqlite3 library. Here’s an example script to set up your database:

python
Copy code
import sqlite3

def setup_database():
    conn = sqlite3.connect('concerts.db')
    cursor = conn.cursor()

    # Create tables
    cursor.execute('''
        CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS bands (
            name TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
            hometown TEXT
        )
    ''')

    cursor.execute('''
        CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS venues (
            title TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
            city TEXT
        )
    ''')

    cursor.execute('''
        CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS concerts (
            id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
            band_name TEXT,
            venue_title TEXT,
            date TEXT,
            FOREIGN KEY (band_name) REFERENCES bands(name),
            FOREIGN KEY (venue_title) REFERENCES venues(title)
        )
    ''')

    conn.commit()
    conn.close()

setup_database()
2. Object Relationship Methods
You need to implement methods for each class to handle the relationships and perform various operations. Below is a Python example of how you can implement these methods using raw SQL queries.

Concert Class Methods
python
Copy code

        cursor = conn.cursor()
        cursor.execute('''
            SELECT * FROM bands
            JOIN concerts ON bands.name = concerts.band_name
            WHERE concerts.id = ?
        ''', (self.id,))
        band = cursor.fetchone()
        conn.close()

            GROUP BY band_name
            ORDER BY num_performances DESC
            LIMIT 1
        ''', (self.title,))
        band = cursor.fetchone()
        conn.close()
        if band:
            return {'name': band[0], 'performances': band[1]}
        return None

        for concert in concerts:
            venue = Venue(concert[2])  # Assuming venue title is at index 2
            intros.append(Concert(concert[0]).introduction())
        return intros

    @staticmethod
    def most_performances():

        if band:
            return {'name': band[0], 'performances': band[1]}
        return None
Testing and Usage
To test the setup, create instances of Band, Venue, and Concert and use the methods defined above to perform various operations. Here’s an example:

python
Copy code
# Create Band and Venue instances
band = Band('The Beatles')
venue = Venue('Madison Square Garden')

# Add a concert
band.play_in_venue('Madison Square Garden', '1965-08-15')

# Retrieve concert info
concert = Concert(1)
print(concert.introduction())  # Example usage

# Get all venues where the band has performed
print(band.venues())

# Get the most frequent band at a venue
print(venue.most_frequent_band())
This should give you a solid foundation for interacting with your database using raw SQL queries. Feel free to adjust the column names and methods based on your specific requirements and database schema.

Sure! Here’s a student-written README file for the Concerts project:

Concerts Database Project
Overview
This project involves managing a database for concerts, bands, and venues. It uses raw SQL queries to handle database operations without using SQLAlchemy or any ORM. The main goal is to practice writing and executing SQL commands directly in Python.

Database Schema
The database consists of three tables:

Bands

name: The name of the band (Primary Key)
hometown: The hometown of the band
Venues

title: The title of the venue (Primary Key)
city: The city where the venue is located
Concerts

id: Auto-incrementing primary key
band_name: Name of the band (Foreign Key referencing bands.name)
venue_title: Title of the venue (Foreign Key referencing venues.title)
date: Date of the concert
Setup
To set up the database and create the required tables, run the following script:

python
Copy code
import sqlite3

def setup_database():
    conn = sqlite3.connect('concerts.db')
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute('''
        CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS bands (
            name TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
            hometown TEXT
        )
    ''')
    cursor.execute('''
        CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS venues (
            title TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
            city TEXT
        )
    ''')
    cursor.execute('''
        CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS concerts (
            id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
            band_name TEXT,
            venue_title TEXT,
            date TEXT,
            FOREIGN KEY (band_name) REFERENCES bands(name),
            FOREIGN KEY (venue_title) REFERENCES venues(title)
        )
    ''')
    conn.commit()
    conn.close()

setup_database()
